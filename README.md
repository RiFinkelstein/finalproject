This is my final project at the end of my course
I have created a website that begins with logging in, with a login and registration page 
once you have logged into the page you will be braught to the main page
from the main page you can chose different pages from the side bar 
you can look at what the page is about, look at a calandar, look at a hebrew date converter (hebcal), then you can find recipes that were added from the editor, then you cna add recipes to the page yourself 
after this is a few tabs that have each of the jewish holidays and on each of these pages there are links to other pages to tell yuo about these holidays
